# GraphLearner
iPad App for 8th graders to learn about graphs.

Learning Objective
Visualize the equation y=m*x+b, y=a sin or cos (bx + c) + d with changing parameters in regards to understanding the active relationship between x and y.
Learn how the arbitrary variables m,b,a,b,c change a certain graph when the values change

Description
The interactive graph learner enables students to understand how graphs are drawn as a result of the relationship between the x and y value. There are four stages of learning a linear equations: y=x, y=x+b, and y=mx+b,  y=a sin or cos (bx + c) . In each stage, students are prompted to draw the line of the given equation. In the latest stages, students are able to manipulate the m,b,a,b,c values of the linear and sine/cosine equations to visualize the changes in those values in the graphs (+ sin/cos value)

Target Audience
8th grade students (currently the common core introduces the most basic form of the equation y=mx+b in the 8th grade)
